Our place is cozy and sun filled and we share it with our super friendly rag-doll, Gobbolino. 
Your private room looks out onto the balcony and comes with a comfortable bed, a desk, lots of books to borrow and a flat screen TV. The complex also has a salt water swimming pool - great for cooling down on a hot day! 
Youâ€™ll have your own bathroom across the hall and the free use of our fully equipped kitchen and laundry room. 
The area is leafy and close to 2 bus stops. 15 min walk to Coogee Beach!
