With stunning views overlooking Randwick Racecourse, this brand new, fully furnished studio apartment merges style with practicality. Sydney's CBD, FOX Studios, Surry Hills, Centennial Park, airport and Sydney's famous, eastern suburbs' beaches including Bondi are all under 15 minutes drive. With underground secure parking and close public transport your new home away from home will provide a hub from which to see the best Sydney has to offer. When possible I allow for early/late check in/out.
