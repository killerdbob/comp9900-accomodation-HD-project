3rd floor apartment with views out over the ocean, walking distance to Coogee and Clovelly beach(15 mins walk), Bondi/Randwick Junction (20 mins walk, 5 mins bus) and 30 min bus into the city. Cafes and shops very close.
The apartment is shared with a quiet, clean and respectful couple (often out or spend time away in their room, so it's like having the place to yourself). They will likely be traveling for parts of the availability also.
