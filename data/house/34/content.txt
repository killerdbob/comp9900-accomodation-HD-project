GARDEN STUDIO - complete with separate bedroom and living/working area. Full of natural light. Walk out into our lovely veggie garden and be greeted by our beautiful pup Ollie. You are welcome to use our kitchen and bathroom facilities in the main house while maintaining your privacy in your own little flat. We are a short walk from ANZAC parade, a casual stroll from the infamous Ritz cinema and a breezy 9 minute drive from the beach!
