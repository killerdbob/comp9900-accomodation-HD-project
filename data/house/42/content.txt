Leafy hideaway a block from the uni and hospital. You'll have bedroom #3 in a 3 bedroom house, sharing with 2 friendly guys in a relaxed home. From the house you can walk to Randwick village, the University of New South Wales (UNSW), the Prince of Wales Hospital and Coogee Beach. The city is 30 minutes away by bus. There's space to chill in the peaceful gardens front & back. Well behaved pets are welcome too. Ours is a gay share household, and everyone is welcome. We'd love to have you.
