Lovely bright room in an Art Deco HOUSE located a short walk to UNIVERSITY of NSW, public transport, walk to Coogee Beach and short bus trip to BONDI and Maroubra beaches, lots of fantastic cheap food outlets, shops, restaurants, bars, medical facilities, fitness clubs, sports venues, glorious Centennial Park and the famous Randwick horse racing track. An AMAZING location!
