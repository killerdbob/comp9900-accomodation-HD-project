My place is close to public transport, the airport, UNSW, Westfield Eastgardens, the city centre, beaches and parks. Youâ€™ll love my place because of the neighbourhood, the cosiness and the handy centralised location. My place is good for solo adventurers. Nice restaurants within walking distance too.
